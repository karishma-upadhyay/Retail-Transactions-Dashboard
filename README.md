# Retail-Transactions-Dashboard
I made this using Qlik Sense.
1) Data Visualization: The dashboard provides interactive visualizations to help users explore data efficiently.
2) User-Friendly Interface: Designed with ease of use in mind, making data analysis accessible to non-technical users.
3) Dynamic Filters: Includes filters for segmenting data to focus on specific aspects of the data set.
4) Export Options: Users can export data directly from the dashboard for offline analysis.
